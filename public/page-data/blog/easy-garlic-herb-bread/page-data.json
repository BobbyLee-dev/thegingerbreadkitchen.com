Mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl until the dough starts to form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Transfer the dough onto lightly floured surface and knead for 6-8 minutes*. Form the dough into a ball.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Brush a large bowl with oil and transfer the dough into the bowl. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and put the bowl in a warm place, to let the dough rise. Let it rise for 1 hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. When time is up, separate the dough in half, trying not to handle it too much. Form 2 loaves and place them onto a baking tray, leaving extra space around each loaf. Preheat the oven to 450 F. Leave your loaves in a warm place for 40 &#8211; 50 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Once time is up and bread has risen once more, place it in the oven and bake for 20 &#8211; 25 minutes. When ready, bread should be golden-brown and sound hollow if you tap on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>* If the dough sticks to the hands and is hard to handle, add more flour a little bit at a time, until it stops sticking to your hands when kneaded.</p>\n","uri":"easy-garlic-herb-bread","excerpt":"<p>Ingredients: 4 ½ &#8211; 5 Cups of bread flour 1 Tbsp sugar 2 ½ tsp salt 2 ½ tsp instant yeast 1 ⅔ Cups warm water 5 cloves of garlic, minced finely 1 Tbsp fresh or dried rosemary 1 Tbsp fresh or dried thyme INSTRUCTIONS: 1.
